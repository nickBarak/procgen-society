You will find yourself in a small, entirely procedurally generated society  

Naturally, the game will be initialized to some definitive state - though random  

Some alternative target world state will be established subsequent to world generation  

You will not be privy to this alternative state, but will need to achieve it to advance  

You will need to sleuth through dialogue with NPCs to identify your objectives  

In order to achieve the target state, you will need to manipulate the state of the society through dialogue  

Once the conditions of the target state are satisfied, you will be transported to another society  

Subsequent societies will be lower in size, but more difficult to manipulate  

Difficulty may be derived from magnitude of difference between initial and target states or impressionability of NPCs

You will have limited time to complete the objectives
